    <div class="color-swatch" style="background-color: #000080;" data-description="This one’s your strength. The part of you that holds it together even when everything feels like it’s falling apart.
You don’t always show it, but I see it. You carry people. You carry me."></div>
    <div class="color-swatch" style="background-color: #B39DDB;" data-description="Your comfort is soft lavender. This is you when you're being the softest version of yourself — the you that checks in on me when I don't even know I need it.
You're my calm. My “everything’s gonna be okay” voice. if the comfort you provide was a color, it would be this."></div>
    <div class="color-swatch" style="background-color: #f47ebb;" data-description="This one’s your heart. The quiet kind of love you give — the remembering-my-favourite-thing kind, the “tell me when you get home” kind. YOU are the definition of love, even when you forget it."></div>
    <div class="color-swatch" style="background-color: #F28500;" data-description="This one? This is your loud laugh in public that makes everyone stare — and us not caring one bit. It’s your random bursts of energy, the way you pull me into impulsive plans that end up being the best memories. It’s your boldness. Your fire. The “I said what I said” energy. Tangerine is you when you’re living out loud and making life way more fun than it has any right to be."></div>
    <div class="color-swatch" style="background-color: #ffffff;" data-description="This is your honesty. The way you don’t fake things, even when it’s hard. It’s how you let people see the real you — the unfiltered, sleepy-eyed, vulnerable you. It’s those deep talks at 1am when we forget about time. This color is every fresh start you've ever taken, every time you've picked yourself back up. You’re light. Not loud light — the gentle kind that makes people feel like they’re home."></div>
  <div class="color-swatch" style="background-color: #000000;" data-description="This one’s your power — the kind people feel before they even hear you speak. It’s the way you walk through chaos like, “I’ve survived worse.” You’re not cold — you’re just selective with your heart. This is you when you’re in full “main character, don’t mess with me” mode. It’s the outfits. The looks. The vibe. The way you somehow make hoodie + that EYELINER look like a fashion statement. Black is the confidence you carry without even trying."></div>
<div class="color-swatch" style="background-color: #b1f0b1;" data-description="This one’s your spark — the unexpected pop of energy that lights up any room, even when things feel a little stuck. You’re that fresh breeze that shifts the mood and reminds me how fun life can be. Lime green is your playful side, the part of you that’s always ready to try something new or make me laugh when I least expect it. You bring growth and fresh vibes, and honestly, you make everything around you feel a little more alive just by being you."></div>
